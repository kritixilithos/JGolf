# JGolf (open-source esoteric programming language that is basically Java, but golfed)

###LICENSED UNDER MIT

**LANGUAGE UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

This is an esoteric programming language I am trying out (after failing with Carrot because I eventually gave up after being lost in the messy source code).

That is why I have created JGolf, a golfed-version of Java. This language is meant for people who find it hard or time-consuming to learn one of the popular, yet hard to learn, esolangs, so I created JGolf for people familiar with C-based languages, like Java.
I started developing this on 2016/10/29. But I honestly don't know how long will I continue contributing to it. So the community is free to make changes and edit the compiler to add more features and stuff.


#Getting Started

Download `compile.java` and `jgolf.sh`

**Note! YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE JAVA ALREADY INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE**

Then execute `javac compile.java` to compile the file

Now create a `.jgolf` program **in the same folder** and and save it as `filename.jgolf`

Finally, execute `sh jgolf.sh filename` (`filename` is **without extensions** or otherwise there will be ERRORS!)

**THERE WILL BE DEBUG MESSAGES IN THIS DEVELOPING VERSION OF THE COMPILER**

DONE!

**Note! All the files (`compile.java`, `jgolf.sh` and the jgolf file) have to be in the same directory.**

###Command-Line Arguments Usage

    sh jgolf.sh filename argument1 argument2 argument3 ...

Where `argument1`, `argument2`, ... are the arguments that are passed as command-line arguments to the JGolf program.


##But I want to learn the language...

All right, no worries, that is why I have created this [wiki](https://github.com/kritixilithos/JGolf/wiki) to help you learn the language.
