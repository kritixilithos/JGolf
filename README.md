# JGolf (open-source esoteric programming language that is basically Java, but golfed)

**LANGUAGE UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

This is an esoteric programming language I am trying out (after failing with Carrot because I eventually gave up after being lost in the messy source code).

That is why I have created JGolf, a golfed-version of Java. This language is meant for people who find it hard or time-consuming to learn one of the popular, yet hard to learn, esolangs, so I created JGolf for people familiar with C-based languages, like Java.
I started developing this on 2016/10/29. But I honestly don't know how long will I continue contributing to it. So the community is free to make changes and edit the compiler to add more features and stuff.


#Getting Started

Download `compile.java` and `jgolf.sh`

**Note! YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE JAVA ALREADY INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE**

Then execute `javac compile.java` to compile it

Now create a `.jgolf` program and and save it as `filename.jgolf`

Finally, execute `sh jgolf.sh filename` (`filename` is without extensions)


**THERE WILL BE DEBUG MESSAGES IN THIS DEVELOPING VERSION OF THE COMPILER**

DONE!
